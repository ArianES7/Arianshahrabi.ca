# Hi — I’m Arian.

I’m a gameplay & systems programmer. I like building the “invisible” parts that make games feel good: movement, combat loops, enemy behaviors, simulation tools, and the workflow glue that lets a team iterate without stepping on each other.

If you’re a recruiter, the fastest path is **Projects**. Each one is written as: **goal → constraints → what I owned → results**.

#### Systems-first mindset
I treat games as modular systems that interlock cleanly: input, movement, combat, AI, spawning, saving, UI, and tooling.

---

#### Performance-aware
I profile, measure, and optimize. I care about stable frame-time and predictable behavior, not “it feels faster.”

---

#### Practical AI
FSMs, behavior trees, and utility-style decision making — tuned for readable debugging and iteration.

---

#### Simulation / physics tools
Verlet systems, constraints, collisions, and material-driven behavior — built with clarity and testability.

## How I work

1. **Define the win condition.** What does “done” look like? What can be measured?
2. **Prototype fast.** Build a thin vertical slice that proves the loop.
3. **Harden the system.** Refactor for readability, add tests/diagnostics, and make it easy for others to extend.

I’m at my best when there’s a real problem to solve and a clear target quality bar.
