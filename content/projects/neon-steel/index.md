## Overview

Neon Steel is my capstone project with Bloodfeather Studio. My focus is to help the team ship a polished, playable product while keeping systems clean and easy to extend.

<!--more-->

## What I did

- Production: planning, task clarity, unblocking, keeping scope realistic
- Gameplay programming & level design contributions (systems integration, iteration)
- UI/UX support where needed

## Constraints

- Team project: work has to be predictable and non-destructive (clear ownership)
- Scope discipline: every feature needs to justify its cost

## How I kept things within scope

- Modular systems approach (movement/combat/AI/spawning/UI are separate and composable)
- Small testable slices before we “scale” a feature
- Documentation that makes it hard to break things accidentally

## Next improvements

- Public case study with screenshots + metrics once we hit our next milestone
