## Summary
Rogue Malfunction is a puzzle adventure where you control a robot fighting an external system that **overrides and remaps inputs**. Each room is a self-contained puzzle, and on first entry the game can remap your controls, forcing you to adapt fast. 

## Core systems
### Control Remapping (the main mechanic)
- Room-driven remaps of WASD inputs
- The “learning curve” is the puzzle: you identify how movement is currently behaving, then route through hazards accordingly 

### Puzzle Rooms + Hazards
- Each room acts as a contained challenge space
- Focus on layout reading + timing movement around traps 

### Build scope (current)
Current build includes:
- One complete control-remapping puzzle
- Isometric movement and hazard navigation
- Core shifting-input mechanic 

## Controls
- W / A / S / D: Move (intentionally remapped in some rooms)
- Space: Jump
- LMouse: Interact 

## Road to 1.0
Planned expansion to four distinct puzzle rooms, each exploring a different layer of control chaos.
